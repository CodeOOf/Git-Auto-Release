# Create PR: bugfix/fix-critical-issue → main
```

**Result after merge**: `v0.1.1-beta` tag created, VERSION updated

---

### Production Release

```bash
# Release tested beta to production
# Create PR: main → release

# On GitHub:

## 📊 Version Progression Cheat Sheet

### Standard Version Bumps

| Merge Action | Current | Next Version | Tag Created | Notes |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| feature/* → main | 0.1.0 | 0.2.0-beta | v0.2.0-beta | MINOR bump |
| bugfix/* → main | 0.1.0 | 0.1.1-beta | v0.1.1-beta | PATCH bump |
| main → release | 1.0.0-beta | 1.0.0 | v1.0.0 | Production release |
| hotfix → release | 1.0.0 | 1.0.1 | v1.0.1 | Emergency fix |

### Major Release Progression

| Step | Merge Action | Version Created | Tag | Branch Created |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-----|----------------|
| 1 | alpha → main | 1.0.0-alpha | v1.0.0-alpha | beta (auto) |
| 2 | beta → main | 1.0.0-beta | v1.0.0-beta | - |
| 3 | main → release | 1.0.0 | v1.0.0 | - |

### Beta Refinement (During Major Beta Release)

| Merge Action | Current | Next Version | Tag Created | Notes |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| feature/* → main | 1.0.0-beta | 1.0.0-beta.1 | v1.0.0-beta.1 | .N increment (no new minor bump) |
| bugfix/* → main | 1.0.0-beta.1 | 1.0.0-beta.2 | v1.0.0-beta.2 | .N increment |
| feature/* → main | 1.0.0-beta.2 | 1.0.0-beta.3 | v1.0.0-beta.3 | .N increment (no new minor bump) |
| bugfix/* → main | 1.0.0-beta.3 | 1.0.0-beta.4 | v1.0.0-beta.4 | .N increment |

**Key Rule**: During a **major beta release** (VERSION = `X.0.0-beta` from beta branch merge), ALL subsequent merges to main result in `.N` increments. Regular feature/bugfix merges outside of major releases continue to bump versions normally (e.g., `v0.2.0-beta`, `v0.3.0-beta`, `v0.1.1-beta`).

### Build Versions (Development, No Tags)

| Branch Type | Version Format | Example |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| feature/* | base+commit | v0.1.0+c8d92a14 |
| bugfix/* | base+commit | v0.1.0+f14e2c91 |
| alpha | base+commit | v0.1.0+a3f2b1c8 |
| hotfix | base-hotfix.N | v1.0.0-hotfix.1 |

## ✍️ Commit Message Format

Following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for structured, semantic commit messages:

```
type(scope): short description

[optional body explaining what and why]

[optional footer with breaking changes or issue refs]
```

### Commit Types Reference

| Type | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat` | New features | `feat(auth): add OAuth2 support` |
| `fix` | Bug fixes | `fix(api): handle null responses correctly` |
| `feat!` | Breaking changes | `feat!(api): redesign REST endpoints to GraphQL` |
| `docs` | Documentation only | `docs(readme): update installation instructions` |
| `style` | Code formatting | `style(app): fix indentation in main.js` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | `refactor(auth): simplify token validation` |
| `perf` | Performance improvements | `perf(db): optimize query performance` |
| `test` | Adding tests | `test(auth): add token validation tests` |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | `chore(deps): update dependencies` |

### More Examples

```bash
# Feature with details
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): add user analytics chart

- Added chart component with D3.js
- Integrated with analytics API
- Added date range selector"

# Bug fix with issue reference
git commit -m "fix(login): prevent duplicate submissions

Closes #123"

# Breaking change with migration notes
git commit -m "feat!(api)!: change authentication to JWT

BREAKING CHANGE: API now requires JWT tokens instead of API keys.
Clients must update to use Authorization: Bearer <token> header."
```

> **💡 Important**: Version bumps are determined by **branch type**, not commit messages!
> - `feature/*` → main = MINOR bump → `vX.Y+1.0-beta` (normal beta tag)
> - `bugfix/*` → main = PATCH bump → `vX.Y.Z+1-beta` (normal beta tag)
> - `alpha` → main = MAJOR bump → `vX+1.0.0-alpha` (creates beta branch)
> - `beta` branch → main = `vX.0.0-beta` (major beta release)
> - ANY merge → main during **major beta** (VERSION = `X.0.0-beta`) = `.N` increment (e.g., v1.0.0-beta.1, .2, .3)
> - `hotfix` → release = PATCH bump
>
> **During major beta release only**: No new major/minor bumps allowed - all changes get `.N` increments!
>
> Use conventional commits for clarity and changelog generation, not versioning control.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Workflow Not Running

```bash
# 1. Verify workflow file exists
ls .github/workflows/ci-cd-versioned.yml

# 2. Check GitHub Actions is enabled
# Go to: Settings → Actions → General → Enable

# 3. Check branch protection allows workflow
# Settings → Branches → Edit protection rules
```

### Wrong Version Calculated

```bash
# Check current VERSION
cat VERSION

# Verify branch name pattern
git branch --show-current

# Expected patterns:
# - feature/name  → MINOR bump
# - bugfix/name   → PATCH bump  
# - alpha         → MAJOR bump
# - hotfix        → PATCH bump

# View CI logs for version calculation
# GitHub → Actions → Latest run → Calculate Version job
```

### Merge Conflicts in VERSION

```bash
# Always choose the higher version
git checkout --theirs VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit

# Or manually edit VERSION to higher number
echo "1.2.3" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit
```

### Tag Already Exists

```bash
# Delete tag locally
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Delete tag remotely
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0

# Force push the corrected commit
# (Only if safe to do so!)
git push --force-with-lease
```

### CI Tests Fail

```bash
# Run tests locally first
npm test
# or
python -m pytest
# or
cargo test

# Check specific job logs
# GitHub → Actions → Failed run → Click failing job

# Re-run failed jobs
# GitHub → Actions → Failed run → Re-run failed jobs
```

### Branch Protection Blocks Merge

```bash
# Ensure all required checks pass
# - Build & Test must be green
# - Calculate Version must complete
# - Required reviews must be approved
# - All conversations must be resolved

# View protection rules
# Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
```

## 📁 Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose | When to Edit |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `VERSION` | Current semantic version | Never manually (auto-updated by CI) |
| `.github/workflows/ci-cd-versioned.yml` | CI/CD automation | When customizing workflow |
| `BRANCH_STRATEGY.md` | Branch rules and flows | Reference only |

Yes! The workflow detects both regular merges (2 parents) and squash merges (PR# in commit message).

### How do I rollback a release?

1. **For beta/alpha**: Revert the merge to main
2. **For production**: Create a hotfix branch from release with the fix, or revert and create new release

### Why did my workflow fail with "tag already exists"?

Someone may have manually created the tag. Delete it and re-run:
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
```

### Can I customize the tag format?

Yes, edit the workflow's tag creation step. Default is `v{VERSION}` (e.g., v1.0.0).

### Can I merge alpha (breaking changes) during a major beta release?

**No, alpha merges to main are NOT allowed during a major beta release.** Here's why and what to do:

**Why Not?**
- A major version bump is the highest possible version increment
- Once you're in a major beta release (e.g., VERSION = `1.0.0-beta` from beta branch merge), you've already claimed that major version
- There cannot be two major bumps in parallel - you can't have `v1.0.0-beta` and start `v2.0.0-alpha` simultaneously
- During major beta release (VERSION = `X.0.0-beta`), ALL merges to main (feature or bugfix) must increment build metadata (`.N`) only

**Note**: Regular feature/bugfix merges outside of major beta releases continue to create normal beta tags: `v0.2.0-beta`, `v0.3.0-beta`, etc.

**What To Do If You Have Breaking Changes During Beta?**

**Option 1: Delay Breaking Changes (Recommended)**
1. Complete current beta and release to production (`v1.0.0`)
2. Then create alpha branch for breaking changes
3. Merge alpha → main for `v2.0.0-alpha`
4. Create new beta branch and proceed with `v2.0.0-beta`

**Option 2: Abandon Current Major Beta and Restart**
1. If the major beta is not production-ready and needs major changes, preserve the work in alpha but remove it from main:
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Create alpha branch from current main (preserves all the work)
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b alpha
   git push -u origin alpha
   
   # Step 2: Reset main to before the major version bump
   # Find the commit hash before alpha was originally merged to main
   git log --oneline main  # Find the commit before the alpha merge
   git checkout main
   git reset --hard <commit-hash-before-alpha-merge>
   
   # Step 3: Verify and restore VERSION file to pre-alpha state
   # VERSION should now be back to what it was (e.g., 0.x.x)
   cat VERSION  # Verify it's correct (e.g., 0.5.0, not 1.0.0-alpha)
   
   # Push the reset
   git push origin main --force  # ⚠️ Use with caution, coordinate with team
   
   # Step 4: Delete all major beta tags (work continues in alpha, tags removed)
   git tag -d v1.0.0-alpha v1.0.0-beta
   git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0-alpha :refs/tags/v1.0.0-beta
   
   # Step 5: Continue development in alpha
   git checkout alpha
   # All the work from the beta is preserved here
   # VERSION in alpha still contains 1.0.0-beta (or latest .N version)
   git merge feature/your-breaking-change  # Add more breaking changes if needed
   git commit -m "feat!: incorporate additional breaking changes"
   git push origin alpha

If you encounter issues or have questions, check the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for solutions and guidance.
   # When ready, restart the major release process:
   # Create PR: alpha → main (will create v1.0.0-alpha, update VERSION to 1.0.0-alpha, and create beta branch)
   ```
   
   **⚠️ Important**: This approach uses `git reset --hard` and force push, which rewrites main's history. The work continues in alpha as if the merge to main never happened. VERSION in main reverts to pre-alpha state, while VERSION in alpha retains the major version. Coordinate with your team!

**Option 3: Start New Alpha for Next Major Version**
1. If you need breaking changes but current major beta must still be released:
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Create new alpha branch for next major version (v2.x.x)
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b alpha
   git push -u origin alpha
   
   # Step 2: Develop breaking changes in this new alpha
   git checkout alpha
   git merge feature/your-breaking-change
   git commit -m "feat!: breaking changes for v2.0.0"
   git push origin alpha
   # Note: VERSION in alpha still shows current main version (e.g., 1.0.0-beta.N)
   # It will be bumped to 2.0.0-alpha when merged to main
   
   # Step 3: Complete and release current major beta first
   # Continue with v1.0.0-beta → v1.0.0 release process
   # Create PR: main → release (produces v1.0.0, VERSION becomes 1.0.0)
   
   # Step 4: AFTER v1.0.0 is released, merge new alpha
   # Only then can you merge: alpha → main
   # This will create v2.0.0-alpha and update VERSION to 2.0.0-alpha
   ```
   
   **Important**: The new alpha branch CANNOT be merged to main until the current major version is released to production. This ensures version integrity and prevents conflicting major version bumps. VERSION in main must reach production (X.0.0) before starting the next major cycle (X+1.0.0-alpha).

**Remember**: During a **major beta release** (VERSION = `X.0.0-beta`), the version represents a contract. Once you're in `v1.0.0-beta`, you're committed to releasing `v1.0.0` (or abandoning it). Breaking changes mean a new major version cycle.

### How do I test workflow changes safely?

1. Create a test repository
2. Copy your modified workflow
3. Test all merge scenarios
4. Once confirmed, apply to production repo
